# Top 100 Nintendo Games
This dataset ranks the top 100 Nintendo games of all time dating from 1989 to 2023

# Introduction

In the ever-expanding universe of entertainment, few mediums have captured the imagination quite like video games. With their ability to transport players to fantastical realms, challenge their skills, and evoke a spectrum of emotions, video games have become a cornerstone of modern leisure. Among the giants of gaming, Nintendo stands tall, boasting a legacy rich with iconic characters, innovative gameplay mechanics, and timeless experiences.

For this project, I created a dataset of the top 100 Nintendo games as rated by passionate gamers. This list of games begins from 1989 and continues into 2023. The games are listed by Title, Genre, Developers, IGN Rating, System and more.
